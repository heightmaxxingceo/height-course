Sprints:
Hill or Stairs:
Perform 4-6 sprints of 10 seconds each if you're sprinting on a hill or stairs.

Flat Ground:
Perform 5-10 sprints of 30 seconds each if you're sprinting on flat ground.

Frequency:
It's generally recommended to do sprints 2-3 times per week, but I prefer doing them more frequently.

Box/Stair Jump Down:
Jump down from a box or a flight of stairs, landing on the balls of your feet. Determine the number of reps that work for you. I do 20 reps.

Box/Stair Jump Up:
Jump up onto a box or a flight of stairs, landing on the balls of your feet. Determine the number of reps that work for you. I do 20 reps.

Calf Raises:
Calf raises help stimulate blood flow in the legs and stretch the shins. High reps are recommended, up to 200 reps, but I go until failure, which sometimes is less.

Toe Raises:
Toe raises are the reverse of calf raises. Instead of lifting your heel, lift your toes. You can lean your hip against a wall for added weight and stability. High volume is recommended (200-400 reps), but I go until failure.
I suggest going to failure 2-3 times daily to reach the recommended volume without overexerting.

Dead Hangs:
Dead hangs are beneficial for shoulder health and spinal decompression, potentially aiding in height growth with proper diet and training. Aim for a total of 3 minutes daily, broken into shorter intervals if needed.
Ensure you go until you're almost at your limit but avoid injury from overexertion.

Cobra Stretch:
Assume a cobra stretch position, keeping your feet on the ground. Hold for 30 seconds, and extend the duration as you progress if desired.

Neck Stretches:
Stretch your neck by pushing it down, up, left, and right for 30 seconds each. Then, roll your neck for 10-20 reps in each direction. Keep it simple.

Cat-Cow Stretch:
Alternate between arching your back and rounding it while on all fours, holding each position for 5-10 seconds. Do this for 30 seconds to a minute, increasing the duration as you progress if desired

Rustam Akhmetov, a Ukrainian who reportedly gained 9 inches in height, suggests attaching bands to your feet and below your shoulders to stretch your entire body while sleeping.
Initially, it may feel uncomfortable, but you eventually get used to it, and he claims it works effectively.

However, there's a cautionary note: if you tend to twist and turn a lot in your sleep, this method could be somewhat risky. The stretched position of the spine may leave it vulnerable to injury.

As an alternative, some people recommend using a "decompression table." There's a story of a man who increased his height from 5'6" to 6'2" using the banded sleeping method.

Hopefully you get some good results with all this, take care man.
